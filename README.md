# Peace-Sign-Detector-Using-Yolo
*A deep learning-based approach for detecting peace signs in images.*

## 🚀 Introduction
This project implements a **Peace Sign Detector** using **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**. The goal is to detect and classify peace signs in images with 86% accuracy in validation dataset.

## 📌 Features
- Peace sign detection using YOLO.
- Works with image files.
- **Streamlit-based web app** to upload an image and receive detection results.

## 🏗️ Installation
### 1️⃣ Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Peace-Sign-Detector-Using-Yolo.git
cd Peace-Sign-Detector-Using-Yolo
Remember to change the paths to your own image dataset path(if relative path doesnt work try absolute path too)
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3️⃣ Run
```bash
